[Deploy in RAILS_ENV=development]
  1. Generate the database connection file "database.yml":
      cd config/
      cp database_template.yml database.yml
  2. Fill in correct username and password for the development environment in the file "database.yml". Then if the database was not initially set, you may need to run:
      bundle exec rake db:create
      bundle exec rake db:migrate
  3. <tt>bundle install</tt>
  4. You may clear all old "tmp" or "log" files at this point with:
      bundle exec rake tmp:clear
      bundle exec rake log:clear
  5. Start the packaged Solr distribution with:
      bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start
  6. If it is neccessary, you may reindex all objects with: 
      bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:reindex
  7. Done!
